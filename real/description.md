# Cleaning Data
  This setup is based on two sources:

  1. The cleansing of data of the source: [single-household](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption) is done in the file **__cleansing_single_household.ipynb__**.

  2. The cleansing of data of the source: [multiple-households](https://nbviewer.org/github/isc-konstanz/household_data/blob/2020-04-15/main.ipynb) is done in the file ... (pending).

## The *essential* python (version 3.10.2) libraries to install are:
  ```console
    pip install pandas
    pip install jupyter notebook
  ```
